XSL


XSL (EXtensible Stylesheet Language) enables transform one XML file 
to other XML similar file (XML, XHTML etc.) basing on template from file XSLT.
So in XSL we have 3 documents:
- XSL template: document .xslt with template 
- XML input: document .xml with data which are added to .xslt
- XML output: it can be XML similar document like XML, HTML, XHTML etc.


XSL consists of three parts:
- XSLT: 	a language for transforming XML documents
- XPath: 	a language for navigating in XML documents
- XSL-FO: 	a language for formatting XML documents
