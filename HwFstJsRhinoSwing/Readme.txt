RHINO

You can use Rhino if you want to run Java Script function from Java.

In this example there is a function "sayHelloWorld" 
with String as input and String as output. 

By default file with this function is created in tmp directory
with name "test.js". 

You can change this and upload another js file
with the same function name, input and output.
